Internship Task 1 - Network Scan Report

I performed a network scan on my local network using the Nmap tool.

The scan detected 4 active devices within the network.

I identified the open ports present on these devices.

To protect my privacy, the IP addresses and default gateway information have been masked.

Open ports can pose security risks to the network if not properly managed.
